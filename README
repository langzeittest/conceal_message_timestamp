Module: Conceal Message Timestamp
Version: 1.0.3 Last Edition
Author: Oliver Riesen <oliver@riesen.org>

Conceals message timestamp for messages older than 24 hours. Don't let your
boss know that you wrote at work ...

LAST EDITION!

The functions of this module are now included in the "Readable Dates and
Concealed Times Module" (formerly "Readable Dates Module") from version 1.2.0
and above.

Formatting date and times in two separate modules doesn't work well (see
"known issues"). So I decided to extend the old "Readable Dates Module".

Tested on version 5.2.20
